# CH55x-USB-Blaster Firmware for "REV. C USB BLASTER" board

This is a fork of [CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware by VladimirDuan](https://github.com/VladimirDuan/CH55x-USB-Blaster) that runs on a cheap clone Altera USB Blaster I bought on Amazon. On the outside it says "Rev. c" and it uses a CH552G chip. It works correctly in Linux and Windows with my limited testing, no special drivers required.

Compile with [ch554_sdcc SDK](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/ch554_sdcc).
